# Biathlon Olympic Data Viz, 1924-2014

A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski through a cross-country trail system whose total distance is divided into either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total skiing distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.

A _biathlon_ competition consists of a race in which contestants ski through a cross-country trail system whose total distance is divided into either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total skiing distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.

This is the steps in determining the ratio of Men and Women Participants won a Gold, Bronze and Silver medals through the use of analytical graphs for easier understanding.

## *_Steps:_*
1. Understand the table and identify the data needed.
2. Filter the data to Biathlon Sport  in order to get the number of participants. 
3. Filter into men and women to identify the gender ratio
4. Filter into three types of Medal such as Gold, Bronze and Silver.
5. Create a summary based on the given categories.
6. Create a any type of chart to serves as the visual explanation.
7. Provide a brief explanation based on the visual shown

## *_Considerations:_*
Use of _Illustrator and Photoshop_ to start conceptualizing the design.
Once the design is formulated, Use [Python](https://www.python.org/)in creating graphs.
Use Use _HTML, CSS_ in order to publish it to the web.
Always make the graphs simple and easy to understand.
